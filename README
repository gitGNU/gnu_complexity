complexity
==========

I mostly try to keep information about this in docs that get put up
on the web:
  http://www.gnu.org/software/complexity/manual/html_node/index.html

If there are omissions, please let me know.
Provided you have the full installation of autogen:
  http://www.gnu.org/software/autogen
(including libopts and templates), then building and installing
should be little more than:
  configure && make && make install
