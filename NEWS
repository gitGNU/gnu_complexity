New in 1.3 - October 2015

* src/complexity.c: explicitly include headers that are needed but
  usually included by config.h.
  (die): It is claimed that va_start() may expand to unbalanced
  opening braces, so add va_end().  This is not true, but added
  va_end() for balance anyway.
* doc/Makefile.am: add "mk.sh" to EXTRA_DIST
* incorporate a spelling fix from autogen

New in 1.2

* Programming / configuration cleanups

* Print scaling factors in output header
